# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is the starting point for your CMPM 121 D1 project. The goal of this project is to create a simple web application using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices. Students should make sure to remove _this_ content from their README.md file and replace it with their own project documentation.
